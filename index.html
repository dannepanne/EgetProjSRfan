            Sega Rally Championship is a 1994 racing video game developed by
            Sega AM3 and published by Sega. Originally released for arcades
            using the Sega Model 2 board, it was converted to the Sega Saturn in
            1995 and Windows in 1997. The unique selling point of Sega Rally
            Championship was the ability to drive on different surfaces, with
            different friction properties, with the car's handling changing
            accordingly. As the first racing game to incorporate this feature,
            Sega Rally Championship is considered to be one of the milestones in
            the evolution of the racing game genre. It was also an early rally
            racing game and featured cooperative gameplay alongside the usual
            competitive multiplayer.
